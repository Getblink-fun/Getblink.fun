# GetBlinks.fun

[GetBlinks.fun](https://www.getblink.fun/) is a no-code platform designed to simplify the process of creating and sharing Solana Blinks directly on social media platforms. 

[Blinks](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions) simply means Blockchain Links and they are unique, shareable links that enable blockchain interactions seamlessly on Social media platforms. Currently, Blinks are supported exclusively on ùïè (formerly Twitter) and work only on desktop screens. However, future updates may bring support for additional platforms and screen sizes.

To start viewing blinks on your ùïè timeline:

1. **Install a Solana-Compatible Wallet Extension**  
   - Download a Chrome wallet extension like **Phantom** or **Solflare**.  

2. **Set Up Your Wallet**  
   - Open the wallet extension in your browser and create a wallet (or log in if you already have one).  

3. **Enable Solana Actions on ùïè**  
   - Open your wallet extension.  
   - Go to **Settings** > **Experimental Features**.  
   - Activate **Solana Actions on ùïè** to allow your wallet to interact with blockchain links on the platform.
   - Refresh the page to start veiwing blinks on your ùïè timeline.

## Why GetBlinks.fun
Traditionally, creating a Blink involves:
1. Writing the backend logic for the Blink.
2. Hosting the backend on a suitable platform.
3. Registering the Blink on the Blinks Registry with a valid domain (not a free domain like `.vercel.app` or `.netlify.app`).
4. Ensuring your backend logic works correctly.

For developers, this process can be time-consuming, and for non-technical users, it‚Äôs overwhelming. **GetBlinks.fun** eliminates these complexities by offering a no-code solution for creating Blinks effortlessly.
